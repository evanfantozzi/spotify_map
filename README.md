# üéß Welcome to *Your Spotify World!*

This is my first web app, born out of a curiosity to explore where my music comes from.  
With that in mind, I built an app that:

- Fetches your **top Spotify artists** (think Spotify Wrapped)  
- Queries their **birthdates and hometowns** using an open-source music encyclopedia  
- Displays everything on an **interactive map** üåç  
- And, thanks to a friend's suggestion ‚Äî includes a fun **astrological breakdown** of your top artists ‚ú®

I use APIs from [**Spotify**](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api), [**MusicBrainz**](https://musicbrainz.org/), and **OpenStreetMap** to run the app. Because MusicBrainz is open-source, you might notice a few artists with incomplete or incorrect info ‚Äî I‚Äôm actively working to improve that, but [let me know](mailto:evanfantozzi@gmail.com) about any that you notice.

If you'd like to try out the app, [send me your email](mailto:evanfantozzi@gmail.com) and I‚Äôll get you access! Since this is a personal project, Spotify requires keeping the app in *developer mode*, meaning I manually share access to users. Once I do, you'll be able to access the app [**here**](https://evanfantozzi.pythonanywhere.com).
