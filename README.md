Welcome to Your Spotify World! This is my first web app. I've always been curious about seeing where my music comes from. With that in mind, I built an app that to fetch your top artists (similar to Spotify Wrapped), query their birthdates and hometowns in a Wiki-type database, and display them on an interactive map. At the suggestion of a friend, I also added a breakdown of top artists by astrological sign.

I used APIs from Spotify, MusicBrainz, and OpenStreetMap. Due to the open source nature of MusicBrainz, some artists may have incomplete or incorrect information. Please message me with any bugs or issues to fix. Additionally, as this is a personal project, the app is in developer mode and I need to manually add users. Please message me your email if you'd like to try out my app and I'll set you up.!
