# 🎧 Welcome to *Your Spotify World!*

This is my first web app, born out of a curiosity to explore where my music comes from.  
With that in mind, I built an app that:

- Fetches your **top Spotify artists** (think Spotify Wrapped)  
- Queries their **birthdates and hometowns** using an open-source music encyclopedia  
- Displays everything on an **interactive map** 🌍  
- And, thanks to a friend's suggestion — includes a fun **astrological breakdown** of your top artists ✨

I use Django and APIs from [**Spotify**](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api), [**MusicBrainz**](https://musicbrainz.org/), and **[Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/)** to run the app. Because MusicBrainz is open-source, you might notice a few artists with incomplete or incorrect info — I’m actively working to improve that, but [let me know](emailto:evanfantozzi@gmail.com) about any that you notice.

If you'd like to try out the app, [send me your email](mailto:evanfantozzi@gmail.com) and I’ll get you access! Since this is a personal project, Spotify requires keeping the app in *developer mode*, meaning I manually share access to users. Once I do, you'll be able to access the app [**here**](https://evanfantozzi.pythonanywhere.com).
